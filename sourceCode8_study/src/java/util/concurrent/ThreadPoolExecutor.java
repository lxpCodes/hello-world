/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} that executes each submitted task using
 * one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured
 * using {@link Executors} factory methods.
 * 一个{@link ExecutorService}，它使用多个池线程中的一个来执行每个提交的任务，
 * 通常使用{@link Executors}工厂方法配置。
 *
 * <p>Thread pools address two different problems: they usually
 * provide improved performance when executing large numbers of
 * asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead,
 * and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources,
 * including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks.
 * Each {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} also maintains some basic
 * statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.
 * 线程池解决了两个不同的问题:由于降低了每个任务的调用开销，
 * 线程池通常在执行大量异步任务时提供更好的性能;
 * 线程池还提供了一种方法来约束和管理执行一组任务时消耗的资源(包括线程)。
 * 每个{@code ThreadPoolExecutor}还维护一些基本的统计信息，比如已完成任务的数量
 *
 * <p>To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
 * provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility
 * hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient
 * {@link Executors} factory methods {@link
 * Executors#newCachedThreadPool} (unbounded thread pool, with
 * automatic thread reclamation), {@link Executors#newFixedThreadPool}
 * (fixed size thread pool) and {@link
 * Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor} (single background thread), that
 * preconfigure settings for the most common usage
 * scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually
 * configuring and tuning this class:
 * 为了在广泛的上下文中发挥作用，这个类提供了许多可调参数和可扩展性挂钩。
 * 然而,程序员要求使用更方便{@link Executors}工厂方法
 * {@link Executors#newCachedThreadPool}(无界的线程池,线程自动回收),
 * {@link Executors#newFixedThreadPool}(固定大小的线程池)
 * 和{@link Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor}(单个后台线程),
 * 预先设置为最常见的使用场景。否则，在手动配置和调优该类时，请使用以下指南
 *
 * <dl>
 *
 * <dt>Core and maximum pool sizes</dt>
 *
 * <dd>A {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} will automatically adjust the
 * pool size (see {@link #getPoolSize})
 * according to the bounds set by
 * corePoolSize (see {@link #getCorePoolSize}) and
 * maximumPoolSize (see {@link #getMaximumPoolSize}).
 *
 * When a new task is submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)},
 * and fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, a new thread is
 * created to handle the request, even if other worker threads are
 * idle.  If there are more than corePoolSize but less than
 * maximumPoolSize threads running, a new thread will be created only
 * if the queue is full.  By setting corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize
 * the same, you create a fixed-size thread pool. By setting
 * maximumPoolSize to an essentially unbounded value such as {@code
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE}, you allow the pool to accommodate an arbitrary
 * number of concurrent tasks. Most typically, core and maximum pool
 * sizes are set only upon construction, but they may also be changed
 * dynamically using {@link #setCorePoolSize} and {@link
 * #setMaximumPoolSize}. </dd>
 * 当一个新任务被方法{@link #execute(Runnable)}提交，并且线程数量比正在
 * 运行的核心数量少，会创建一个新线程来处理这个请求，即使其他工作线程是空闲的
 * 如果线程数量多于核心线程数但少于最大线程数，当队列满的情况下才会创建新线程
 * 如果核心线程数与最大线程数一致，就创建了一个固定大小的线程池
 * 如果最大线程数设置为一个无界的数，比如Integer.MAX_VALUE，代表线程池容纳任意数量的并发任务
 * 通常核心和最大数只能通过构造设置，但是应该可以通过set方法改变
 *
 * <dt>On-demand construction</dt>
 *
 * <dd>By default, even core threads are initially created and
 * started only when new tasks arrive, but this can be overridden
 * dynamically using method {@link #prestartCoreThread} or {@link
 * #prestartAllCoreThreads}.  You probably want to prestart threads if
 * you construct the pool with a non-empty queue. </dd>
 * 默认情况下，即使是核心线程最初也只在新任务到达时创建并启动，
 * 但是可以使用方法{@link #prestartCoreThread}或{@link #prestartAllCoreThreads}动态覆盖。
 * 如果使用非空队列构造池，可能需要预启动线程。
 *
 * <dt>Creating new threads</dt>
 *
 * <dd>New threads are created using a {@link ThreadFactory}.  If not
 * otherwise specified, a {@link Executors#defaultThreadFactory} is
 * used, that creates threads to all be in the same {@link
 * ThreadGroup} and with the same {@code NORM_PRIORITY} priority and
 * non-daemon status. By supplying a different ThreadFactory, you can
 * alter the thread's name, thread group, priority, daemon status,
 * etc. If a {@code ThreadFactory} fails to create a thread when asked
 * by returning null from {@code newThread}, the executor will
 * continue, but might not be able to execute any tasks. Threads
 * should possess the "modifyThread" {@code RuntimePermission}. If
 * worker threads or other threads using the pool do not possess this
 * permission, service may be degraded: configuration changes may not
 * take effect in a timely manner, and a shutdown pool may remain in a
 * state in which termination is possible but not completed.</dd>
 * 使用{@link ThreadFactory}创建新线程。如果没有另外指定，则使用
 * {@link Executors#defaultThreadFactory}，它将创建具有相同{@linkThreadGroup}
 * 和相同{@code NORM_PRIORITY}优先级和非守护进程状态的线程。
 * 通过提供不同的线程工厂，您可以更改线程的名称、线程组、优先级、守护进程状态等。
 * 如果{@code ThreadFactory}调用{@code newThread}请求创建线程时失败且返回null，
 * 执行器将继续执行，但可能无法执行任何任务。
 * 线程应该拥有“modifyThread”{@code RuntimePermission}。
 * 如果使用池的工作线程或其他线程不拥有此权限，则服务可能会降级:配置更改可能不会及时生效，
 * 关闭池可能会保持可能终止但未完成的状态
 * <dt>Keep-alive times</dt>
 *
 * <dd>If the pool currently has more than corePoolSize threads,
 * excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more
 * than the keepAliveTime (see {@link #getKeepAliveTime(TimeUnit)}).
 * This provides a means of reducing resource consumption when the
 * pool is not being actively used. If the pool becomes more active
 * later, new threads will be constructed. This parameter can also be
 * changed dynamically using method {@link #setKeepAliveTime(long,
 * TimeUnit)}.  Using a value of {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} {@link
 * TimeUnit#NANOSECONDS} effectively disables idle threads from ever
 * terminating prior to shut down. By default, the keep-alive policy
 * applies only when there are more than corePoolSize threads. But
 * method {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)} can be used to
 * apply this time-out policy to core threads as well, so long as the
 * keepAliveTime value is non-zero. </dd>
 * 如果池当前有超过corePoolSize大小的线程，如果空闲时间超过keepAliveTime，
 * 则多余的线程将被终止(参见{@link #getKeepAliveTime(TimeUnit)})。
 * 这提供了在池不被积极使用时减少资源消耗的方法。如果以后池变得更加活跃，
 * 就会构造新的线程。这个参数也可以使用方法{@link #setKeepAliveTime(long,TimeUnit)}动态更改。
 * 使用值{@code Long.MAX_VALUE} {@link TimeUnit#NANOSECONDS}有效地禁止空闲线程在关闭之前终止。
 * 默认情况下，保持活动策略仅适用于超过corePoolSize的线程。但是方法{@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)}也可以用于将这个超时策略应用到核心线程，只要keepAliveTime值非零
 *
 * <dt>Queuing</dt>
 *
 * <dd>Any {@link BlockingQueue} may be used to transfer and hold
 * submitted tasks.  The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:
 * 可以使用任何{@link BlockingQueue}来传输和持有提交的任务。此队列的使用与池大小调整交互
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers adding a new thread
 * rather than queuing.</li>
 * 如果运行的线程少于corePoolSize大小，执行程序总是倾向于添加一个新线程，而不是排队
 *
 * <li> If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor
 * always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new
 * thread.</li>
 * 如果corePoolSize或更多线程正在运行，执行程序总是倾向于将请求排队，而不是添加一个新线程
 *
 * <li> If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless
 * this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be
 * rejected.</li>
 * 如果一个请求不能排队，就会创建一个新线程，除非这个线程超过maximumPoolSize，在这种情况下，任务将被拒绝
 * </ul>
 *
 * There are three general strategies for queuing:
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> <em> Direct handoffs.</em> A good default choice for a work
 * queue is a {@link SynchronousQueue} that hands off tasks to threads
 * without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task
 * will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a
 * new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when
 * handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.
 * Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to
 * avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the
 * possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to
 * arrive on average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
 *
 * 直接传递：对于工作队列，一个好的默认选择是{@link SynchronousQueue}，
 * 它将任务分配给线程，而不需要占用它们。在这里，如果没有立即可用的线程来运行任务，
 * 那么对任务进行排队的尝试将失败，因此将构造一个新线程。
 * 在处理可能具有内部依赖关系的请求集时，此策略避免了锁定。
 * 直接移交通常需要无限制的maximumPoolSizes，以避免拒绝新提交的任务。
 * 反过来，当命令的平均到达速度超过了它们的处理速度时，就有可能导致无限制的线程增长。
 *
 * <li><em> Unbounded queues.</em> Using an unbounded queue (for
 * example a {@link LinkedBlockingQueue} without a predefined
 * capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all
 * corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize
 * threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize
 * therefore doesn't have any effect.)  This may be appropriate when
 * each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot
 * affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server.
 * While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out
 * transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of
 * unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on
 * average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
 * 无界队列：使用无边界队列(例如没有预定义容量的{@link LinkedBlockingQueue})
 * 将导致当所有corePoolSize线程都很忙时，新的任务在队列中等待。
 * 因此，创建的线程不会超过corePoolSize。(因此maximumPoolSize的值没有任何影响)
 * 当每个任务完全独立于其他任务时，这可能是合适的，因此任务不会影响彼此的执行;
 * 例如，在web页面服务器中。虽然这种排队方式在平滑短暂的突发请求方面很有用，
 * 但它也承认，当命令的平均到达速度超过处理速度时，工作队列可能会无限制地增长
 *
 * <li><em>Bounded queues.</em> A bounded queue (for example, an
 * {@link ArrayBlockingQueue}) helps prevent resource exhaustion when
 * used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to
 * tune and control.  Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded
 * off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes
 * CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can
 * lead to artificially low throughput.  If tasks frequently block (for
 * example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule
 * time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues
 * generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but
 * may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
 * decreases throughput.  </li>
 * 有界队列：有界队列(例如{@link ArrayBlockingQueue})在使用有限的最大池大小时有助于防止资源耗尽，
 * 但可能更难调优和控制。
 * 队列大小和最大池大小可以相互交换:使用大队列和小池可以最小化cpu使用量、操作系统资源和上下文切换开销，
 * 但可能导致人为的低吞吐量。如果任务经常阻塞(例如，如果它们是I/O绑定的)，
 * 那么系统可以为更多的线程调度时间，而不允许这样做。
 * 使用小队列通常需要更大的池大小，这会使cpu保持忙碌，但可能会遇到不可接受的调度开销，这也会降低吞吐量
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Rejected tasks</dt>
 *
 * <dd>New tasks submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)} will be
 * <em>rejected</em> when the Executor has been shut down, and also when
 * the Executor uses finite bounds for both maximum threads and work queue
 * capacity, and is saturated.  In either case, the {@code execute} method
 * invokes the {@link
 * RejectedExecutionHandler#rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor)}
 * method of its {@link RejectedExecutionHandler}.  Four predefined handler
 * policies are provided:
 * 在执行器被关闭时，以及在执行器对最大线程和工作队列容量都使用有限边界且已饱和时，
 * 提交到{@link #execute(Runnable)}的新任务将被拒绝。
 * 在任何一种情况下，{@code execute}方法都会调用其{@link RejectedExecutionHandler}的
 * {@link RejectedExecutionHandler}方法。提供了四个预定义的处理程序策略
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> In the default {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy}, the
 * handler throws a runtime {@link RejectedExecutionException} upon
 * rejection. </li>
 * 抛出异常
 *
 * <li> In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy}, the thread
 * that invokes {@code execute} itself runs the task. This provides a
 * simple feedback control mechanism that will slow down the rate that
 * new tasks are submitted. </li>
 * 调用者自己处理：这提供了一个简单的反馈控制机制，可以降低新任务的提交速度
 *
 * <li> In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy}, a task that
 * cannot be executed is simply dropped.  </li>
 * 拒绝，不抛异常
 *
 *
 * <li>In {@link ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy}, if the
 * executor is not shut down, the task at the head of the work queue
 * is dropped, and then execution is retried (which can fail again,
 * causing this to be repeated.) </li>
 * 扔掉排队时间最久的
 * 如果执行器没有关闭，则删除工作队列头部的任务，然后重试执行(可能再次失败，导致重复执行)。
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * It is possible to define and use other kinds of {@link
 * RejectedExecutionHandler} classes. Doing so requires some care
 * especially when policies are designed to work only under particular
 * capacity or queuing policies. </dd>
 * 可以定义和使用其他类型的{@link RejectedExecutionHandler}类。
 * 这样做需要一些注意，特别是当策略被设计为仅在特定容量或排队策略下工作时
 *
 * <dt>Hook methods</dt>
 *
 * <dd>This class provides {@code protected} overridable
 * {@link #beforeExecute(Thread, Runnable)} and
 * {@link #afterExecute(Runnable, Throwable)} methods that are called
 * before and after execution of each task.  These can be used to
 * manipulate the execution environment; for example, reinitializing
 * ThreadLocals, gathering statistics, or adding log entries.
 * Additionally, method {@link #terminated} can be overridden to perform
 * any special processing that needs to be done once the Executor has
 * fully terminated.
 * 这个类提供了{@code protected} overridable {@link #beforeExecute(Thread, Runnable)}
 * 和{@link #afterExecute(Runnable, Throwable)}方法，它们在每个任务执行之前和之后被调用。
 * 这些可以用来操纵执行环境;例如，重新初始化线程局部变量、收集统计信息或添加日志条目。
 * 此外，方法{@link #terminated}可以被覆盖，以执行在执行器完全终止后需要完成的任何特殊处理。
 *
 * <p>If hook or callback methods throw exceptions, internal worker
 * threads may in turn fail and abruptly terminate.</dd>
 * 如果钩子或回调方法抛出异常，内部工作线程可能反过来失败并突然终止
 *
 * <dt>Queue maintenance 队列维护</dt>
 *
 * <dd>Method {@link #getQueue()} allows access to the work queue
 * for purposes of monitoring and debugging.  Use of this method for
 * any other purpose is strongly discouraged.  Two supplied methods,
 * {@link #remove(Runnable)} and {@link #purge} are available to
 * assist in storage reclamation when large numbers of queued tasks
 * become cancelled.</dd>
 * 方法{@link #getQueue()}允许访问工作队列，用于监视和调试。
 * 对于任何其他目的使用这种方法都是非常不鼓励的。
 * 提供的两个方法，{@link #remove(Runnable)}和{@link #purge}，可用于在取消大量队列任务时帮助进行存储回收
 *
 * <dt>Finalization</dt>
 *
 * <dd>A pool that is no longer referenced in a program <em>AND</em>
 * has no remaining threads will be {@code shutdown} automatically. If
 * you would like to ensure that unreferenced pools are reclaimed even
 * if users forget to call {@link #shutdown}, then you must arrange
 * that unused threads eventually die, by setting appropriate
 * keep-alive times, using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or
 * setting {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)}.  </dd>
 * 不再被程序引用且没有空闲线程的线程池将自动{@code shutdown}。
 * 如果你想确保未引用的线程池被回收，即使用户忘记调用{@link #shutdown}，
 * 那么你必须安排未使用的线程最终死亡，通过设置适当的保持活动时间，
 * 使用一个更低的边界零核心线程和/或设置{@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)}。
 *
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p><b>Extension example</b>. Most extensions of this class
 * override one or more of the protected hook methods. For example,
 * here is a subclass that adds a simple pause/resume feature:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class PausableThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
 *   private boolean isPaused;
 *   private ReentrantLock pauseLock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   private Condition unpaused = pauseLock.newCondition();
 *
 *   public PausableThreadPoolExecutor(...) { super(...); }
 *
 *   protected void beforeExecute(Thread t, Runnable r) {
 *     super.beforeExecute(t, r);
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       while (isPaused) unpaused.await();
 *     } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
 *       t.interrupt();
 *     } finally {
 *       pauseLock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void pause() {
 *     pauseLock.lock();
 *     try {

     * The main pool control state, ctl, is an atomic integer packing
     * two conceptual fields
     *   workerCount, indicating the effective number of threads
     *   runState,    indicating whether running, shutting down etc<br>
     *主池控制状态ctl是一个封装了两个概念性字段的原子整数
     *  workerCount，表示线程的有效数量
     *  runState，指示是否运行、关闭等
     *
     * In order to pack them into one int, we limit workerCount to
     * (2^29)-1 (about 500 million 5亿) threads rather than (2^31)-1 (2
     * billion 20亿) otherwise representable. If this is ever an issue in
     * the future, the variable can be changed to be an AtomicLong,
     * and the shift/mask constants below adjusted. But until the need
     * arises, this code is a bit faster and simpler using an int.<br>
     * 为了将它们压缩到一个int中，我们将workerCount限制在5亿个线程，而不是20亿个线程
     * 如果将来出现这个问题，可以将变量改为AtomicLong，并调整下面的shift/mask常量。
     * 但是，除非有需要，否则使用int会更快、更简单一些
     *
     * The workerCount is the number of workers that have been
     * permitted to start and not permitted to stop.  The value may be
     * transiently different from the actual number of live threads,
     * for example when a ThreadFactory fails to create a thread when
     * asked, and when exiting threads are still performing
     * bookkeeping before terminating. The user-visible pool size is
     * reported as the current size of the workers set.<br>
     * workerCount是允许开始工作和不允许停止工作的工作线程数量。
     * 这个值可能暂时与活动线程的实际数量不同，例如，当线程工厂在请求时未能创建线程，
     * 以及退出线程在终止之前仍在执行登记时。用户可见的池大小被报告为工作者设置的当前大小
     *
     * The runState provides the main lifecycle control, taking on values:
     *
     *   RUNNING:  Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
     *             接受新任务并处理排队的任务
     *   SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks
     *             不接受新任务但处理排队的任务
     *   STOP:     Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks,
     *             and interrupt in-progress tasks
     *             不接受新任务，不处理排队的任务并且中断正在处理的任务
     *   TIDYING:  All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero,
     *             the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
     *             will run the terminated() hook method
     *             所有任务都已终止，workerCount为零，转换到TIDYING状态的线程将运行terminated()钩子方法
     *   TERMINATED: terminated() has completed
     *             terminated() 已执行完成
     *<br>
     * The numerical order among these values matters, to allow
     * ordered comparisons. The runState monotonically increases over
     * time, but need not hit each state.
     * 为了允许有序的比较，这些值之间的数字顺序很重要。运行状态单调地随时间增加，但不需要达到每个状态
     * The transitions are:
     *
     * RUNNING -> SHUTDOWN
     *    On invocation of shutdown(), perhaps implicitly in finalize()
     *    调用shutdown()时 ，可能发生在finalize()调用时隐式调用
     * (RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -> STOP
     *    On invocation of shutdownNow()
     * SHUTDOWN -> TIDYING
     *    When both queue and pool are empty
     *    队列和线程池都空时
     * STOP -> TIDYING
     *    When pool is empty
     *    线程池为空时
     * TIDYING -> TERMINATED
     *    When the terminated() hook method has completed
     * Threads waiting in awaitTermination() will return when the
     * state reaches TERMINATED.
     * 当terminated()钩子方法执行完毕后,等待awaitTermination()的线程将在状态达到TERMINATED时返回
     *<br>
     * Detecting the transition from SHUTDOWN to TIDYING is less
     * straightforward than you'd like because the queue may become
     * empty after non-empty and vice versa during SHUTDOWN state, but
     * we can only terminate if, after seeing that it is empty, we see
     * that workerCount is 0 (which sometimes entails a recheck -- see
     * below).
     * 检测从SHUTDOWN过渡到TIDYING不如你想的简单直接，因为在关闭状态下，非空队列可能变为空队列,反之亦然,
     * 但我们只能终止,如果在看到它是空的,我们看到workerCount 0(有时需要复核,见下文)

     * Main worker run loop.  Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and

     * 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we
     * don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is
     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     *
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we
     * ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have
     * its interrupt set.
     *
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     *
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute.
     * We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the
     * specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.
     * Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we
     * wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's
     * UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     *
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     *
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.
